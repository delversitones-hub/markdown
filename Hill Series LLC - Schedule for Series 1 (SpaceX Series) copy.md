<h1 style="text-align: left;">Supplement to the LLC Operating Agreement.</center>

This Schedule 1 (this “<u>Schedule</u>”) applicable to Interests in SpaceX Series {{{Series_Name}}}(the “<u>Series</u>”) of Hill Series LLC (“<u>Series Interests</u>”) and effective as of [•], 2025 {{{Effective_Date}}}(the “<u>Effective Date</u>”), supplements the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Hill Series LLC, dated as of [•], 2025 (the “<u>Operating Agreement</u>”), and is incorporated and made a part thereof. To the extent that any term of this Schedule conflicts with the Operating Agreement, this Schedule shall govern, solely with respect to the Series Interests.

Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to those terms in the Operating Agreement. Additional defined terms are included below in Section 14.

**Designation.** The LLC Manager has authorized the issue of Series Interests and has designated the terms and conditions thereof as set forth herein.

**Classes.** One class of Series Interests has been established. The LLC Manager may, at any time and in its sole discretion, establish additional classes, with such terms and conditions as the LLC Manager may determine.

**Investment Objective.** The investment objective of the Series is to achieve superior, long-term investment returns by investing in, and disposing of, the Series Investment (as defined below).

**Investment Strategy.** The Series’ investment strategy is to invest in {{{SpaceX SPV Name}}},[^1] a special purpose vehicle investing in the common shares of Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (commonly known as “SpaceX”), an aviation and aerospace company that designs, manufactures, and launches rockets and spacecraft (the “<u>Series Investment</u>”).

<h1 style="text-align: left;">Admission of Series Members.</h>

The minimum investment amount for a Series Interest shall be [Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000)].[^2] Notwithstanding the foregoing, the LLC Manager, in its sole discretion, may waive such minimum investment amount.

As of the Effective Date, each Person whose subscription for a Series Interest in the Company has been accepted by the LLC Manager, in its sole discretion, shall become a Series Member (and shall be shown as such on the books and records of the Series) upon the execution and delivery by (or, pursuant to a power of attorney, on behalf of) such Person and the LLC Manager of counterparts of the Operating Agreement. The LLC Manager does not intend to admit additional Series Members to the Series, except solely as a result of a transfer by a Series Member pursuant to and in accordance with the Operating Agreement, or as a result of a default with respect to a Series Member and the imposition of applicable remedies in accordance with the Operating Agreement.

<h1 style="text-align: left;">Capital Contributions.</h>

As of the Effective Date, each Series Member shall make an initial Capital Contribution in the amount set forth in such Series Member’s Subscription Agreement, as accepted by the LLC Manager (the “<u>Initial Capital Contribution</u>”) (a) to fund the Series Investment and pay the Subscription Fee (as defined below); (b) to establish reasonable reserves for Series Expenses and the Series’ proportional share of the expenses to be incurred by the LLC Manager and Hill Capital LLC (the “<u>Management Company</u>”) in providing their services to the Company and the Series, to the extent all such expenses are expected to be incurred during the ten (10)-year period following the Effective Date; and (c) to retain cash on hand.

Each Series Member hereby agrees to make additional Capital Contributions to the Company in connection with Capital Call Notices (as defined below) issued by the LLC Manager from time to time to fund expenses, pursuant to Section 7.3; _provided_, _however_, that with respect to each Series Seven Member, the aggregate amount of such additional Capital Contributions shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of such Series Seven Member’s Initial Capital Contribution (the “<u>Capital Contribution Limit</u>”).

Subject to the Capital Contribution Limit, additional Capital Contributions shall be made during the Term by the Series Members, _pro rata_ in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests, if and when called by the LLC Manager pursuant to a written notice to each Series Member (each, a “<u>Capital Call Notice</u>”), to pay Series Expenses, to reimburse LLC Manager and/or Management Company expenses, or to establish, in the sole discretion of the Managing Manager, reasonable reserves therefor; _provided_, that the LLC Manager shall issue Capital Call Notices not less than four (4) Business Days [^3] prior to the date on which such Capital Contribution is to be made. Each Series Member shall remit to the Company the amount specified in such Capital Call Notice on or before the due date specified therein. Each Capital Call Notice shall specify (a) the aggregate amount then being called for by the Company in respect of the Series Interests; (b) the portion thereof to be contributed by each Series Member; and (c) the purpose for which the Capital Contributions are required to be made.

To the extent that the Series Investment seeks additional investments of capital at any time after the Company has deployed all of its available capital with respect to the Series Investment, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Company shall offer the members the opportunity to contribute, in the members’ discretion, additional Capital Contributions to the Company to fund such additional investments in the Series Investment.

To the extent that not all members elect to increase their capital contributions on a _pro rata_ basis, the LLC Manager shall have the right to issue additional classes of Series Interests in connection with any circumstance described in Section 7.4, in its sole and absolute discretion.

Each member expressly acknowledges that if a “pay-to-play” provision is triggered with respect to additional investments in the Series Investment, and the member does not contribute additional capital to the Company in connection therewith pursuant to Section 7.4, such member can expect to suffer adverse consequences in connection with such member’s indirect investment in the Series Investment, including, without limitation, dilution and/or conversion of preferred stock into common stock.

Each Series Member acknowledges that except as specifically provided in this Schedule (a) no Series Member can be assured of the return of such Series Member’s Capital Contributions; (b) no interest or other rate of return shall accrue on any Capital Contribution; (c) no Series Member shall have the right to withdraw or to be repaid any Capital Contribution made by him or it or to receive any other payment in respect of his or its Series Interest, including, without limitation, as a result of the withdrawal of such Series Member from the Company; (d) no Series Member shall have the right to demand or receive property other than cash in return for his or its Capital Contribution; and (e) no Series Member shall have priority over any other Series Member either as to the return of his or its Capital Contributions or as to allocations and distributions.

A record of all Capital Contributions shall be maintained at the principal office of the LLC Manager. Except as otherwise determined by the LLC Manager in his sole discretion, all Capital Contributions must be made in U.S. dollars by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

**Capital Accounts.** Immediately upon the LLC Manager’s acceptance of a Series Member’s Capital Contribution, the Company shall establish a Capital Account in respect of such Series Member’s Capital Contribution, the initial balance of which shall be equal to the amount of such Series Member’s Capital Contribution to the Series. The LLC Manager, in its sole discretion, may establish sub-accounts with respect to the Capital Accounts of one or more Series Members. Capital Accounts shall be adjusted as provided in the Operating Agreement and this Schedule.

**Management.** Not in limitation of the authority granted to the LLC Manager in the Operating Agreement, the LLC Manager shall have the power on behalf of and in the name of the Series to carry out any and all of the objects and purposes of the Series and to perform all acts that the LLC Manager in its sole discretion deems necessary, desirable, or appropriate in connection therewith, including, without limitation, the power:

on behalf of the Series, to implement the Series’ investment strategy;

on behalf of the Series, to delegate certain portfolio management and administrative responsibilities to one or more Persons that may or may not be Affiliates of the LLC Manager; including the Management Company; _provided_, that such Persons shall be subject to the obligations and restrictions otherwise applicable to the LLC Manager as set forth in this Agreement or pursuant to applicable law, including the Delaware Act; and

on behalf of the Series, to engage in any other lawful transaction in Series Investments at such times and in such amounts as the LLC Manager, in its sole discretion, may determine from time to time.

**Expenses.**

_Subscription Fee_[^4]

        (a) The Series shall pay to the Manager or its Affiliate, and the Interests shall be charged their pro rata portions (based on their capital commitments) of a subscription fee (the “Subscription Fee”). The initial Subscription Fee shall be due on the date on which the Series first accepts Capital Contributions and shall be five hundred basis points (5%) of such Series Member’s Initial Capital Contribution. A subsequent Subscription Fee shall be due in connection with the transfer of an interest upon the transferee becoming a Series Member in accordance with the Operating Agreement. Such subsequent Subscription Fee shall be five hundred basis points (5%) of such Series Member’s Percentage Interest of the net asset value of the Series as of the date the transferee becomes a Series Member.

_Series Expenses._

The Series shall bear all of its own operating expenses, which expenses may include, without limitation, legal, compliance, audit, and accounting expenses (including third party accounting services); start-up expenses; organizational expenses; investment expenses; any entity level taxes or withholding; and any other expenses reasonably related to the operation of the Series, or the purchase, sale, or transmittal of assets.

For the avoidance of doubt, Series Expenses shall include that portion of the Company Expenses incurred by the Company that, in the LLC Manager’s sole discretion (as described in the Operating Agreement), it is fair and equitable for the Series to bear. The expenses specifically applicable to the Series and the Series’ proportional share of Company Expenses together are “<u>Series Expenses.</u>”

_Responsibility for Expenses._ Responsibility for Series Expenses shall be determined as follows:

Except as set forth in Subsection 10.3(b) below, Series Expenses shall be allocated to and funded by each Series Member _pro rata_, in accordance with such Series Member’s Percentage Interest.

Notwithstanding Subsection 10.3(a) above, each Series Member’s responsibility for Series Expenses may be adjusted to reflect an increase in the Capital Contribution of an existing Series Member.

Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Operating Agreement or this Schedule, the Series shall reimburse the LLC Manager and Management Company for all Series Expenses incurred by the LLC Manager and Management Company, respectively, on behalf of the Series.

**Distributions.**

_Distributions, Generally._ Distributions of Available Cash made pursuant to this Schedule shall be distributed on a Series Member-by-Series Member basis as follows (and any amounts withheld for taxes shall be treated as having been distributed for purposes of the calculations described below):

Distributions of Available Cash shall be made to the Series Members at such times as the LLC Manager may determine in its sole discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, tax distributions are not expected to be made.

The LLC Manager, in its sole discretion, may cause the Series to retain any Available Cash in order to pay Series Expenses and to fund reserves for reasonably anticipated Series Expenses.

The LLC Manager shall apportion and distribute, as set forth below, all Available Cash, if any, in the manner set forth below, and pursuant to the terms and conditions herein. The LLC Manager shall tentatively apportion such Available Cash among all Series Members (based on their respective Percentage Interests (after adjusting for any distributions that were made on a basis other than _pro rata_ among all such Series Members). One hundred percent (100%) of such amount tentatively apportioned to the LLC Manager in respect of its investment, if any, in the Series shall be distributed to the LLC Manager. The amounts tentatively apportioned to the other Series Members shall be distributed, on a Series Member-by-Series Member basis, as follows:

first, one hundred percent (100%) of such tentatively apportioned amounts shall be distributed to such Series Member (but excluding any defaulting Series Member) to the extent necessary so that such Series Member shall have received cumulative aggregate distributions (including all prior distributions of Available Cash made pursuant to this Section 11.1(c)(i)) equal to the aggregate amount of such Series Member’s Capital Contributions; and

thereafter, eighty-two and one-half percent (82.5%) of such remaining tentatively apportioned amounts, if any, shall be distributed to such Series Member (but excluding any defaulting Series Member), and seventeen and one-half percent (17.5%) of such remaining tentatively apportioned amounts shall be distributed to the LLC Manager.

The LLC Manager shall have the right to reduce, waive, assign, participate, or otherwise share the Incentive Distributions allocable with respect to any Series Member (including any Affiliate of the LLC Manager or the Management Company) without the consent of, or notice to, any other Series Member.

If (A) the Series incurs a liability or obligation; and (B) the Series does not have sufficient available funds or other resources to satisfy such liability or obligation, then the LLC Manager may require that each Series Member return distributions to the Series, upon not less than ten (10) Business Days’ prior written notice from the Manager, _pro rata_ in proportion to the Series Members’ Percentage Interests at the time at which the liability or obligation arose, in an aggregate amount that is equal to the amount necessary to satisfy such liability or obligation; _provided_, _however_, that a Series Member shall not be required to return any amount pursuant to the foregoing sentence after the two (2) year anniversary of the dissolution of the Series. Except with the express written consent of the LLC Manager, each Series Member shall be jointly and severally liable with its predecessors in interest, if any, for amounts owed hereunder in respect of any predecessor in interest to such Series Member, and distributions made to a Series Member’s predecessor in interest shall be deemed to have been made to such Series Member for purposes of this Section 11.1(e).

For the avoidance of doubt, any distributions that are actually recalled and returned to the Series shall be taken into account for purposes of future distributions pursuant to the distribution waterfall set forth above, and in determining whether the respective thresholds for each tier of the waterfall have been met with respect to such distributions.

**Withdrawals.** The Series Investment will be illiquid. Consequently, voluntary withdrawals from the Series will not be permitted. A Series Member should expect to hold its entire Series Interest until the final disposition of the Series Investment.

**Compulsory Withdrawal.** The LLC Manager, in its sole discretion, may, at any time and for any or no reason, require that any Series Member withdraw all or any portion of its Series Interests.
