SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT</h>

Hill Series LLC – SpaceX Series
c/o Hill Capital LLC
345 California Street, Suite 600
San Francisco, CA 94104

Ladies and Gentlemen:

	The Subscriber (as defined below) desires to subscribe for and purchase an Interest in the Fund. The Interest will be issued in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Subscription Agreement and in the Operating Agreement. Unless otherwise defined, capitalized terms used herein are used as defined in the Operating Agreement.

	In furtherance of the foregoing, and in order to induce the Fund to accept the Subscriber’s subscription, the Subscriber agrees as follows:

<center>PART I - GENERAL REPRESENTATIONS AND COVENANTS</center>

Subject to the acceptance of this subscription by the LLC Manager, on behalf of the Series, the individual or entity that will be the beneficial owner of the Interest (the “Subscriber”), either directly or through its undersigned nominee, hereby irrevocably subscribes for and agrees to purchase an Interest for the total subscription amount indicated on Exhibit A annexed hereto.

The undersigned, for itself as Subscriber or as nominee for the Subscriber (the “<u>Undersigned</u>”), represents and warrants to the Fund that:

if a corporation or other entity, the Subscriber: (i) is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation, and was not formed for the specific purpose of acquiring the Interest; (ii) has full power and authority to enter into, and perform its obligations under, this Subscription Agreement and the Operating Agreement; (iii) is bound and obligated by this Subscription Agreement and the Operating Agreement, which are valid and enforceable against it in accordance with their respective terms; and (iv) has authorized, by all necessary corporate or other action, the execution, delivery, and performance of this Subscription Agreement and the Operating Agreement, the terms of which will not violate any contract, restriction, or commitment of, or applicable to, the Subscriber or any of its affiliates, or, to the best of the Subscriber’s knowledge, any applicable law or government regulation;

the Subscriber is acquiring the Interest for its own account for investment and not with a view to resale, transfer, or otherwise dispose thereof in whole or in part;

the Subscriber (or the person making the investment decision on behalf of the Subscriber) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of this investment;

the Subscriber has received a copy of and its authorized representative has read and understands the Operating Agreement and this Subscription Agreement. The Subscriber understands that there are substantial risks involved in an investment in the Series. The Subscriber has had an opportunity to review the Operating Agreement and this Subscription Agreement and to ask questions of, and receive answers from, the Fund concerning the Fund, the Series, the terms and conditions of this offering, and such additional information as it considers necessary to evaluate appropriately an investment in the Series;

the Subscriber realizes that because of the inherently speculative nature of an investment program of the kind engaged in by the Series, the results of the Series’ operations may be expected to vary from month-to-month and from period-to-period. The SpaceX Series Investment will involve a high degree of financial and market risk that can result in a complete loss of the Subscriber’s investment in the Series. The Subscriber’s acquisition of an Interest is based upon its own analysis of the benefits of an investment in the Series; it is and will be able to bear the economic risk of its investment in the Interest for an indefinite period of time, and its investment in the Series will not adversely affect its overall need for diversification and liquidity;

the Subscriber understands and agrees to make the contributions of capital pursuant to the terms of the Operating Agreement. The Subscriber also understands the default provisions for failing to make a timely capital contribution as set forth in the Operating Agreement, including, without limitation, potential imposition of interest on the overdue amounts, suspension of distributions, reduction, or forfeiture of its Interest;

the Subscriber, in connection with its investment in the Fund, has obtained and complied with all necessary and appropriate legal and tax advice, registrations, declarations, and filings with, and licenses, approvals, and authorizations of, governmental authorities;

the Subscriber affirms that he, she, or it is not subject to any “bad actor” disqualifications, as described in Rule 506(d) under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”);

the Subscriber understands (i) the investment objective, investment strategy, and policies of the Series; (ii) the manner in which profits and losses will be allocated; and (iii) the risks associated with the method of allocating income to the LLC Manager under the Operating Agreement;

the Subscriber understands that the LLC Manager, in its sole and absolute discretion at any time, may require a SpaceX Series Member to withdraw from the Series, in whole or in part (as described in the Operating Agreement). Further, it understands the limited withdrawal rights granted to the SpaceX Series Members; and

the Subscriber understands that Lowenstein Sandler LLP acts as counsel to the Fund, the LLC Manager, the Management Company, and certain of their affiliates. The Subscriber also understands that, in connection with this offering of Interests and subsequent advice to the Fund, Lowenstein Sandler LLP will not be representing investors in the Fund, including the Subscriber, and no independent counsel has been retained to represent investors in the Fund.

The Undersigned further represents and warrants that:

the Subscriber has received and carefully read and understands the privacy policies of the Fund attached hereto as Exhibit D;

the Subscriber acknowledges and understands that the Interests are not registered for sale to the public under the Securities Act or the laws of any state or other jurisdiction. The Subscriber understands that the Interests have not been registered under the Securities Act in reliance on an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering, and will not be so registered. The Subscriber acknowledges that the offer and sale of Interests to the Subscriber has not been accomplished by any form of general solicitation or general advertising, including, without limitation: (i) any advertisement, article, notice, or other communication published in any newspaper, magazine, or similar media, or broadcast over television or radio; and (ii) any seminar or meeting the attendees of which had been invited by any general solicitation or advertising;

## the Subscriber shall not permit any other person to have a beneficial interest in the Subscriber’s Interest, and the Subscriber shall not sell, assign, transfer, convey, encumber, or otherwise dispose of all or any portion of the Subscriber’s Interest except (i) in accordance with the Operating Agreement; (ii) with the consent of the LLC Manager, which such consent may be granted or withheld in its sole and absolute discretion; and (iii) in compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities or “Blue Sky” laws (unless an exemption from registration under the Securities Act or such state laws is available);

## if the Subscriber is a “disregarded entity” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that the representations and warranties made by the Subscriber in this Subscription Agreement are also true and correct as to the Subscriber’s (direct or indirect) sole owner; and

## if the Subscriber is a partnership, grantor trust, S corporation, or other flow-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each, a “Flow-Through Entity”), that (i) substantially all of the value of any beneficial owner’s interest in the Flow-Through Entity is not attributable to the Flow-Through Entity’s interest in the Fund and (ii) a principal purpose of the Flow-Through Entity is not to permit the Fund to satisfy the 100 partner limitation in Section 1.7704-1(h)(1)(ii) of the Treasury Regulations.

# The Subscriber hereby agrees to become a SpaceX Series Member in the Fund on the terms and conditions set forth in the Operating Agreement and this Subscription Agreement. The Subscriber hereby ratifies, adopts, accepts, and agrees to be bound by all of the terms and provisions of the Operating Agreement and to perform all obligations therein imposed upon a SpaceX Series Member with respect to the Interest purchased. Upon acceptance of this Subscription Agreement by the LLC Manager, and by virtue of the Subscriber’s execution of this Subscription Agreement, the Subscriber shall be deemed to have executed the Operating Agreement and shall become a SpaceX Series Member of the Fund.

# The Subscriber is entering into this Subscription Agreement relying solely on the facts and terms set forth in this Subscription Agreement and the Operating Agreement, all of which were received by the Subscriber prior to executing this Subscription Agreement, and neither the Fund, the LLC Manager, the Management Company, or any other person or entity has made any representation of any kind or nature to induce the Subscriber to enter into this Subscription Agreement or the Operating Agreement. The Subscriber has not relied on any representations other than those in this Subscription Agreement and the Operating Agreement provided by the Fund. The Subscriber is not relying on the Fund, the LLC Manager, or the Management Company with respect to the individual or partnership tax consequences associated with an investment in the Fund.

# The Undersigned hereby represents that if the Subscriber is a corporation, partnership, or trust, and is not itself an employee benefit plan, then no more than twenty four and nine-tenths percent (24.9%) of the value of any class of equity interests in the Subscriber is held by benefit plan investors within the meaning of the U.S. Department of Labor Final Regulation Relating to the Definition of Plan Assets, 29 CFR Parts 2509, 2510, and 2550.

# The Undersigned hereby represents that the information contained herein is complete and accurate as of the date hereof and may be relied upon by the Fund. The Undersigned further represents that the Subscriber will notify the Fund in writing immediately of any change such information and/or if any of the representations or warranties contained in this Subscription Agreement becomes untrue.

# The Subscriber understands that the Fund may require other documentation (including tax forms and information) in addition to this Subscription, and the Fund reserves the right to request such documentation at any time.

# The Subscriber understands that the Fund or its agent will inform the Subscriber whether its subscription has been accepted. The Subscriber acknowledges that the LLC Manager reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to reject this and any other subscription, in whole or in part for any or no reason.

# If this subscription is not accepted, the Fund shall return any funds transferred by the Subscriber as soon as practicable. Such funds shall be returned without interest and at the expense of the Subscriber, and this Subscription Agreement and any other documents delivered by the Undersigned may be destroyed by the Fund.

# The Subscriber hereby represents that it will provide, at the request of the Fund or the LLC Manager, information needed for the Fund or any of its affiliates to comply with the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) information reporting and withholding requirements (as set forth in Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder).

# The Undersigned acknowledges that if the Underlying Investor is, or the LLC Manager reasonably believes that the Underlying Investor is, a Prohibited Investor, the LLC Manager may be obligated to freeze its investment, either by prohibiting additional investments, declining any redemption requests, and/or segregating the assets constituting the investment in accordance with applicable regulations, or its investment may be immediately redeemed by the Fund, and neither the Undersigned nor the Underlying Investor shall have any claim against the LLC Manager, the Management Company, or any of its affiliates for any form of damages as a result of the aforementioned actions. The Undersigned further acknowledges that as part of the Fund’s responsibility for protection against money laundering, the Fund and its appointed agents may require additional information, including detailed verification of the identity of the Subscriber. The Undersigned agrees that, upon request of the Fund, it will provide such information as the Fund may require to satisfy applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the Subscriber’s anti-money laundering policies and procedures, background documentation relating to its directors, trustees, settlors, and beneficial owners, and audited financial statements, if any.

PART VII - ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATIONS BY TAX-EXEMPT INVESTORS

# The Subscriber understands:

## If the Subscriber is exempt from the payment of U.S. federal income taxes, an investment in the Fund may subject the Subscriber to U.S. federal income tax on unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”);

PART IX – SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE REPORTING

# The information collected below may be used by the LLC Manager or the Management Company in submitting certain required reports to the SEC and other regulatory bodies.

# For purposes of the questions below, beneficial owners are persons who would be included in determining whether the SpaceX Series Members of the Fund are qualified purchasers under Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act.

**HILL SERIES LLC – SPACEX SERIES**

**SUBSCRIBER INVESTOR QUESTIONNAIRE**

You are being asked to answer the questions that follow in connection with your subscription to purchase an Interest in the Series. The Interests are being offered to qualified investors without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), in reliance on the private offering exemption contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, and Rule 506 of Regulation D (“Regulation D”) promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The availability of the exemption depends, in part, on a determination that each purchaser is able adequately to protect itself in the transaction and does not require the protections afforded by registration. The Series also intends to comply with Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”), which permits private investment companies (such as the Series) to sell their interests on a private placement basis to no more than one hundred (100) beneficial owners.

The information supplied herein will be used in determining whether proposed purchasers of Interests meet such criteria and to determine:

### whether an investment in the Series by the Subscriber is suitable in light of the Subscriber’s financial position;

### whether the Subscriber qualifies as a “Benefit Plan Investor,” as defined and described in this Subscription Agreement;

### whether the Subscriber qualifies as an “accredited investor,” as defined in Regulation D, or is otherwise a suitable investor and has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment; and

I (we) understand the Interests are being issued without registration under the Securities Act in reliance upon the private offering exemption contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, and that such reliance is based in part on the information herein supplied. For the foregoing reasons, and to induce the LLC Manager to accept my subscription for an Interest, I represent and warrant that the information stated herein is true, accurate, and complete; and I agree to notify and supply corrective information immediately if, prior to the consummation of my purchase of an Interest, any of the information provided becomes inaccurate or incomplete. The information will be kept confidential pursuant to the Privacy Notice annexed as Exhibit D.
